# Elasticsearch importer
Transform and import JSON documents into elastic search. Configure indices and transformations with ruby hash.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'es_importer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install es_importer

## Usage

See inline coments:

```ruby
require 'es_importer'

# configure client
EsImporter.configure('http://localhost:9200')

# generate some users
users = (1..100).to_a.map do |i|
  { user_id: i,
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Doe',
    created_at: Time.now.iso8601,
    active: true,
    email: "USER_#{i}@example.com",
    country_code: 'US',
    friends: {
      US: ['Joe']
    }
  }
end

# define elastic id, mapping and keywords for index; provide conversion procs
importer = {

  # name of the index
  users: {

  # build id from single or multiple keys
  id_key: [:user_id, :created_at],

  # define index mapping
  mapping: {
    user_id: :text,
    active: :boolean,
    email: :text,
    created_at: :date,
    country_code: :text
  },

  # keyword generated is 'country_code.keyword'
  keywords: [:country_code],

  converters: {
    # downcase existing field value, second argument is document being processed
    'email' => Proc.new{|attr, _| attr.downcase},

    # add new entry to array under existing nested key
    'friends.US' => Proc.new{|attr| attr << 'Marry'},

    # generate new key with composite value
    'full_name' => Proc.new{|doc| "#{doc['first_name']} #{doc['last_name']}"},

    # generate new nested key as array
    'profile.emails' => Proc.new{|doc| [doc['email']]}
    }
  }
}

# register importer
EsImporter.add_importer(importer)

# create index
EsImporter.create_index!(:users)

# import users
EsImporter.import(:users, users)

#  delete index
EsImporter.delete_index!(:users)

```

AWS elastic instance is also supported, region is extracted from url and credentials are set form ruby SDK.
